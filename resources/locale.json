They are supposed to meet in a fish restaurant in a few minutes to exchange an ancient gold idol for informations about our client. The client wants you to retrieve these informations. Hong and Pritchard don't want to be seen together so they are eating at seperate tables but will make the exchange in about 10 minutes. This cannot happen 47. Our client also wants you to make believe the exchange went wrong between these two to avoid to be under suspicion. Be creative. I've heard the Triad uses special ammo for their rifles. Maybe you can use this information to increminate the Triad in Pritchard's murder...\nThe clock is ticking 47. Good Luck.\nMade by a Peacock community member known as kercyx.",

Der Klient möchte das du diese Informationen besorgst. Hong und Pritchard möchten nicht zusammen gesehen werden also essen sie an getrennten Tischen, aber sie werden den Austausch in ungefähr 10 Minuten durchführen. Das darf nicht passieren, 47. Unser Klient möchte das sie im Glauben gelassen werden, das der Tausch zwischen den Beiden schiefging um keine Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Sei kreativ. Ich habe gehört die Triade benutzt spezielle Munition für ihre Gewehre. Vielleicht kannst du diese Informationen nutzen um die Triade mit Pritchards Mord zu beschuldigen...\nDie Uhr tickt 47.
