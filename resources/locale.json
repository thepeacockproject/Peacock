They are supposed to meet in a fish restaurant in a few minutes to exchange an ancient gold idol for informations about our client. The client wants you to retrieve these informations. Hong and Pritchard don't want to be seen together so they are eating at seperate tables but will make the exchange in about 10 minutes. This cannot happen 47. Our client also wants you to make believe the exchange went wrong between these two to avoid to be under suspicion. Be creative. I've heard the Triad uses special ammo for their rifles. Maybe you can use this information to increminate the Triad in Pritchard's murder...\nThe clock is ticking 47. Good Luck.\nMade by a Peacock community member known as kercyx.",

Австрийский террорист 'Джулиан' планирует взорвать гостиницу. Если это удастся, мир изменится навсегда. \n \n 'Джулиан' — ваша цель.

Normally we would not care about the leaders, but preventing the attack will make us popular with many governments and could mean a new clientele for our business.\n\n Our customer has requested to secure the hotel so your objectives are clear : find Julian and defuse the bomb. \n\nWe think the bomb will explode at 8 PM, so you only have 30 minutes to prevent the explosion.\n\nGood luck 47.\n\n Mission created by Kercyx based on the original Hitman: Codename 47 game.
