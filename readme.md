The Peacock Project is a HITMAN World of Assassination Trilogy server
replacement.
The primary purpose is preservation of the game, but it also adds new features
and
content to the game, and allows for other enhancements to be made while in
online mode.

## Installation

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use the Latest version, or the
version
specifically mentioned here: **Version 18**

Clone the repository where-ever you wish.

Open Windows terminal **AS ADMINISTRATOR**.

Install Yarn, by typing:

> corepack enable

Then move to the folder where you cloned the repo to by using:

> cd Folder/Path/Here

then install the dependencies by using:

> yarn install

## Usage

The project is bundled with a server running configuration.
Run that when editing the project with the IDE of choice, and it should open.

We highly suggest you use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for
development,
but it is a paid product, so you may want to choose something
like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
WebStorm will provide a better experience for development, but VSCode will work
just fine.

## Contributing

Writing bug reports is cool. You should do that. Or update this readme whenever
it's needed.

Thank you to people who have contributed!

## License

## Credits

Peacock started off as a fork
of [LocalGhost](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/LocalGhost)
by grappigegovert, and has since been rewritten in TypeScript, and a whole host
of new features have been added. The codebase has been relicensed to AGPL-3.0
with explicit permission from grappigegovert.

The game is owned by [IO Interactive](https://ioi.dk), and is not affiliated
with this project in any way.
